## Using funnel on a project

1. Visit the Funnel app listing: [https://github.com/apps/funnel](https://github.com/apps/funnel)

2. Click `Configure`

3. Select the organization and project(s) you want to use Funnel on

4. Go to [https://funnel-c5.herokuapp.com/repositories](https://funnel-c5.herokuapp.com/repositories) to configure your repositories.

That's it! ðŸ˜„ Now, funnel will check and watch open pull requests to see if they are ready for merging. It can check to see if your PR is squashed into a single commit, rebased on the base branch, or both!
